Supervised ML
models are trained using labelled dataset, where the model learns about each type of data.

Unsupervised ML
unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset. 
Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data.
just like human brain

Soft Classification
Little error is allowed

Hard Classification
No error allowed

Vector - set of values

margin - called as support vectors
[helps to divide classification dataset]

LSVM - Linear Support Vector Machine

SVM - Support Vector Machine
[used for regression and classification and outliers detection (widely used for classification)]

How it works
Finds a hyperplane in an N-dimention (N - Number of features)
The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features.
features - hyperplane
  2      -    line
  3      -    2D plane
 more    -    difficult to imagine
hyperplane for 3D
hyperline for 2D
Data points lying on either side of hyperplane can be attributed to different class.

Regression - Linear Regression & Logistic Regression
[gives signigicant accuracy with less computational power]

Gradient Descendent - The process of testing each point to find minimum error(called as global minima).
[most common loss function]

Data types - 
i) linearly seperable
[
linear data
any linear classifier will work
eg. LSVM
]

ii) linearly inseperable
[
non-linear data
kernal trick used on dataset
Mathematical Function
or
go for different kernal shapes
]

kernal trick - changes 2D dataset into 3D or N-D hyperplane and then classify the data into linear seperable

Advantages of SVM
i) Effective on high dimensional spaces
still effective where
number of dimensions > number of samples
number of features > number of labels
ii) memory effecient

Note: For more accuracy your dataset should be balanced
i.e each class should have equal number of members
