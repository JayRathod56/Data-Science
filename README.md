1. csv (comma seperated file) - can be open with notepad, excel, etc
2. data - normal file can be opened with notepad, excel, etc
3. .py - a python file can be opened using python idle, notepad, different code editors, etc
4. .ipynb - this file contains python code but you need to open it in google colab or jupyter notebook
