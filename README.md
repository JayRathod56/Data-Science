# Data-Science
Welome to my git repo mate :)

Here we are:
Working with dataframes using pandas, datasets, num py, matplot for plotting graphs
Data Science Models for Regression, Time Series Decomposition, Classification and Clustering

I have uploaded models of Data Science and codes working with basics of data science with the respective dataset used 

Lets talk about the types of file extensions that i have used
1. csv (comma seperated file) - can be open with notepad, excel, etc
2. data - normal file can be opened with notepad, excel, etc
3. .py - a python file can be opened using python idle, notepad, different code editors, etc
4. .ipynb - this file contains python code but you need to open it in google colab or jupyter notebook
